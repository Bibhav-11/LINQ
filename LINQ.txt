LINQ
Linq stands for Language Integreated Query.
Linq is a name for a set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language.
You can write LINQ Queries in C# for SQL server databases, XML documents, ADO.NET Datasets and any collection of objects that supports the IEnumerable or the generic IEnumerable<T> interface.

Extension methods and Lambda Expressions are fundamental to how LINQ is implemented.
The Enumerable and the Queryable class are the two static classes that contains the extension methods.
The Enumerable class and the Queryable class are both members of the System.Linq namespace.

So, to gain access to the extension methods provided through Linq, we can simply include the using directive to the System.Linq namespace.

Linq also provides us with a SQL like query syntax.

Deferred Execution vs Immediate Execution
Adding ToList() makes the execution immediate.
Adding ToList() explicitly converts IEnumerable to List.
